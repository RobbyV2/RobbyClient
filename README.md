# RobbyClient
Still in beta! I'll probably release it when it actually looks good. This is the older source.

Website is still in development, currently version b.17 is made and only availible in a close friend group. Mainly for Hypixel (Very buggy) and BlocksMC.

No, this isn't a skidded client, I just used Nefarious' original TUT videos to get me started (b.1), as when I initially made this, I didn't know much Java.
